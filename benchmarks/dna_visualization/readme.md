# DNA Visualization benchmark
This benchmark requires access to the S3 bucket named `caribou-dna-visualization`,
with the AWS Region set to `us-east-1` (N. Virginia).

Alternatively, the user may change the S3 bucket name and region in `app.py`, 
by changing the values of `s3_bucket_name` and `s3_bucket_region_name` to the 
desired bucket. 

There needs to be a file in the bucket, for example `sequence.gb`, in a folder called `genbank`, 
or a valid DNA sequence input from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/.

You can deploy the benchmark with the following command while inside the poetry environment:

```bash
caribou deploy
```

And then run the benchmark with the following command:

```bash
caribou run dna_visualization-version_number -a '{"gen_file_name": "sequence.gb"}'
```

To remove the benchmark, you can use the following command:

```bash
caribou remove dna_visualization-version_number
```

# Benchmarks

Currently we have the following workflows for benchmarking:

- `benchmarks/dna_visualization`
- `benchmarks/image_processing`
- `benchmarks/map_reduce`
- `benchmarks/text_2_speech_censoring`
- `benchmarks/video_analytics`

Information on how to run each of these are in the respective workflow's README located inside the respective directory.

# Map Reduce Benchmarks
This benchmark requires access to the S3 bucket named `caribou-map-reduce`,
with the AWS Region set to `us-east-1` (N. Virginia).

Alternatively, the user may change the S3 bucket name and region in `app.py`, 
by changing the values of `s3_bucket_name` and `s3_bucket_region_name` to the 
desired bucket. 

There needs to be a folder in the bucket with the base dir (`subset_256MB` in our example) 
inside the input folder containing the input file split in shards.
The input file should be split in shards of the same size.
The number of shards should be specified in the `number_shards` parameter.
The input file size should be specified in the `input_file_size` parameter and is used by the workflow to determine the number of workers.

You can deploy the benchmark with the following command while inside the poetry environment:

```bash
caribou deploy
```

And then run the benchmark with the following command (example):

```bash
caribou run map_reduce-version_number -a '{"input_base_dir": "subset_256MB", "number_shards": 120, "input_file_size": 268435456}'
```

To remove the benchmark, you can use the following command:

```bash
caribou remove map_reduce-version_number
```

## Data preparation

We based the experiment on the [Yelp Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset).

To generate subsets of the dataset, you can use the following command:

```bash
dd if=yelp_academic_dataset_review.json  of=subset_1024MB.txt bs=1M count=1024
```

This command will generate a file of 1024MB, for different sizes you can change the `count` parameter.

To then split the file in shards, you can use the following script:

```bash
mkdir -p chunks && split -n 120 -a 3 subset_1024MB.txt subset_1024MB/chunk_

cd chunks
a=0
for f in chunk_*; do
  mv "$f" "chunk_${a}.txt"
  let a=a+1
done
cd ..
```

This directory can then be directly uploaded to the s3 bucket to the `input` subdirectory.

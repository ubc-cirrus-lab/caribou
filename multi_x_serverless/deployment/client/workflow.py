        :param entry_point: Whether this function is the entry point for the workflow.

        The following is mildly complicated, but it is necessary to make the decorator work.

        The three layers of functions are used to create a decorator with arguments.

        Outermost function (serverless_function):
            This is the decorator factory. It takes in arguments for the decorator and returns the actual
            decorator function.
            The arguments passed to this function are used to configure the behavior of the decorator.
            In this case, name, entry_point, regions_and_providers, and providers are used to configure
            the Lambda function.

        Middle function (_register_handler):
            This is the actual decorator function. It takes in a single argument, which is the function to be decorated.
            It returns a new function that wraps the original function and modifies its behavior.
            In this case, _register_handler takes in func, which is the function to be decorated, and returns wrapper,
            which is a new function that wraps func.
            The middle function is responsible for creating the wrapper function and returning it as well as registering
            the function with the workflow.

        Innermost function (wrapper):
            This is the wrapper function that modifies the behavior of the original function.
            It takes the same arguments as the original function and can modify these arguments
            before calling the original function.
            It can also modify the return value of the original function.
            In this case, wrapper unwraps the arguments of func and retrieves the routing decision
            and calls func with the modified unwrapped payload.

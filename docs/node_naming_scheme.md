# Logical Node Naming Scheme

The naming scheme of the nodes is as follows:

- Initial node: `<function_name>:entry_point:0`
- Intermediate node: `<function_name>:<predecessor_function_name>_<predecessor_index>_<successor_of_predecessor_index>:<index_in_dag>`
  Where `<predecessor_function_name>` is the name of the predecessor function, `<predecessor_index>` is the index of the predecessor function in the dag, `<successor_of_predecessor_index>` is the index of the successor of the predecessor function (when a function calls multiple times the same function, this index is used to distinguish between the different calls), and `<index_in_dag>` is the index of the node in the dag in a topological order of dataflow.
- Synchronization node: `<function_name>:sync:<index_in_dag>`

This naming scheme is used to uniquely identify a node in the logical representation.
The scheme has the implication that colons cannot be allowed in the function names.
